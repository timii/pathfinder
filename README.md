# Pathfinder

Pathfinder aims to visualize different pathfinding algorithms, refresh my knowledge and learn about new pathfinding algorithms I haven't used yet.

Try it out here: [timii.github.io/pathfinder/](https://timii.github.io/pathfinder/)

## Currently available algorithms:

- Unweighted
    - Breadth First Search
    - Depth First Search
- Weighted
    - Dijkstra's Algorithm
    - A*
    - Greedy Best First Search

## Build it yourself

```shell
git clone https://github.com/timii/pathfinder.git
cd pathfinder
```

Open index.html in your web browser to launch the visualizer.

Explore, experiment, and learn about pathfinding algorithms!
